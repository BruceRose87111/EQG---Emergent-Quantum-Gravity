We propose Emergent Quantum Gravity (EQG), a strictly 4D phenomenological frame-
work in which gravity, dark matter-like clustering, and evolving dark energy emerge from
a single deformation of Planck-scale SU(2) spinfoam amplitudes modulated by a compres-
sion density field ρ(t, x). Motivated by Group Field Theory condensate back-reaction and
Compression Invariance, this deformation suppresses high-curvature configurations in dense
regions, generating holographic entropy gradients that drive an entropic force (Eq. 3.1).
EQG recovers General Relativity in the low-density limit yet predicts sharp, multi-messenger
corrections: enhanced attraction in compressed clumps (pure-entropic mechanism, Yukawa-like
at large radii), isotropic monochromatic gamma-ray lines (10–50 GeV) from an optional SU(3)
GFT extension, scale-dependent red tilt in primordial gravitational waves (millihertz band),
low-ℓ CMB suppression, and mild phantom dark energy evolution (w(z) ≈ −0.95 at z ∼ 1).
Recent time-delay cosmography (TDC) results favoring higher H0 and dynamic dark energy
align directionally with EQG’s dilution-driven w(z).
The model is rigorously falsifiable with near-term observations (LISA/BBO, CTA, Eu-
clid/Roman, LIGO O5, CMB-S4, LSST). Null results at conservative thresholds across mes-
sengers would rule out the framework; detections—particularly if consistent—would support
compression-driven emergence of gravity and the dark sectors from quantum geometry. EQG
offers a minimal, background-independent alternative to higher-dimensional or supersymmetric
theories, testable without exotic fields or fine-tuning.
